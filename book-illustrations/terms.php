                                    Our company ethos revolves around granting you ownership of the content we deliver
                                    under the following conditions. The final product we produce holds no proprietary
                                    rights; you are free to utilize it as you see fit.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We require a certain payment in advance for any services we provide. The payment may
                                    vary from client to client. The client must bear partial responsibility for covering
                                    taxes.

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Prior to commencing work, our Amazon KDP Experts engage in one-on-one consultations
                                    with each client to review project requirements. Any discrepancies arising during
                                    service delivery are promptly communicated to you in accordance with our established
                                    terms and conditions.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Refund Procedure</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Refunds will be processed after deducting transactional charges, amounting to $150
                                    or 10% of the purchase price, whichever is lower, provided a full refund is
                                    requested prior to submission of work. Refunds are not issued beyond 90 calendar
                                    days post-purchase. Once payment is made, refunds are not automatically granted.
                                    Clients are not entitled to refunds for "Change of Mind," and Amazon KDP Experts are
                                    under no obligation to provide one.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    No refunds are issued upon final approval of work.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Should you be dissatisfied, we offer a percentage-based refund based on our revision
                                    policies, provided the request is made within the specified timeframe to ensure
                                    mutual satisfaction.
                                </p>
